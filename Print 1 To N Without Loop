Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively.

Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.(GFG)





class Solution
{  
  public void printNos(int N)
    {
       
      
      if (N > 0) {
            printNos(N - 1);
            System.out.print(N + " ");
        }
        return;
    }
}
